This project is a program made in java that will help people with tracking meals that they eat throughout the day to meat macronutrition and calorie goals.

The program will utilize multiple data structures from the Java Collection framework to efficiently store meals the user wishes to include in there diet.

Who are users? People who wish to make tracking their nutrition a more simple process so there is less calculation involved.

What is The purpose? The purpose is to improve and some flaws I have noticed in calorie tracking softwares to make the experience better for the user.

Where and When will the software be used? The software will be used daily by people who are tracking their diets and will run on their computers.

How does this software work? The softwares funcionallity will be mainly focused on using Binary I/O to store and retrieve Meal Objects that the user commonly eats to a file and store them in data structures during run time that can be accessed to give the user helpful information as well as live tracking of what they have ate.

Why would anyone use this software over existing programs? This software will be very specialized to catar to the issues I have encountered with existing macro tracking programs. My hope is that in addressing common downfalls, this program will be very useful to anyone who is tracking their diet.
